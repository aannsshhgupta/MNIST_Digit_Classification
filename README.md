This project demonstrates a neural network-based approach to classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28×28 pixels) representing digits from 0 to 9. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and features a simple architecture with a flattening layer followed by two dense hidden layers using ReLU activation and a final output layer with 10 sigmoid units. The images are normalized before training to ensure faster convergence. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and trained with the sparse categorical crossentropy loss function over 10 epochs. It achieved a test accuracy of 96.79% and a loss of 0.1324, indicating excellent performance in recognizing handwritten digits. The notebook also includes steps for visualizing predictions, converting model outputs to class labels, and analyzing individual samples—making it a complete walkthrough for beginners interested in deep learning and computer vision.
